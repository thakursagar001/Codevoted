<center><h1>Typedef</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>The C programming language provides a keyword called <b>typedef</b>, which you can use to give a type, a new name. Following is an example to define a term <b>BYTE</b> for one-byte numbers &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
typedef unsigned char BYTE;
</pre>
<p>After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type <b>unsigned char, for example.</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
BYTE  b1, b2;
</pre>
<p>By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
typedef unsigned char byte;
</pre>
<p>You can use <b>typedef</b> to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
typedef struct Books {
   char title[50];
   char author[50];
   char subject[100];
   int book_id;
} Book;
 
int main( ) {

   Book book;
 
   strcpy( book.title, "C Programming");
   strcpy( book.author, "Nuha Ali"); 
   strcpy( book.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
   book.book_id = 6495407;
 
   printf( "Book title : %s\n", book.title);
   printf( "Book author : %s\n", book.author);
   printf( "Book subject : %s\n", book.subject);
   printf( "Book book_id : %d\n", book.book_id);

   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Book  title : C Programming
Book  author : Nuha Ali
Book  subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book  book_id : 6495407
</pre>
<h2>typedef vs #define</h2>
<p><b>#define</b> is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to <b>typedef</b> but with the following differences &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>typedef</b> is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as <b>#define</b> can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>typedef</b> interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas <b>#define</b> statements are processed by the pre-processor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows how to use #define in a program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
#define TRUE  1
#define FALSE 0
 
int main( ) {
   printf( "Value of TRUE : %d\n", TRUE);
   printf( "Value of FALSE : %d\n", FALSE);

   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of TRUE : 1
Value of FALSE : 0
</pre>
