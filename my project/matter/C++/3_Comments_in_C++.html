<center><h1>Comments in C++</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Program comments are explanatory statements that you can include in the C++ code that you write and helps anyone reading it's source code. All programming languages allow for some form of comments.</p>
<p>C++ supports single-line and multi-line comments. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by C++ compiler.</p>
<p>C++ comments start with /* and end with */. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* This is a comment */

/* C++ comments can  also
 * span multiple lines
 */
</pre>
<p>A comment can also start with //, extending to the end of the line. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main() {
   cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World"; // prints Hello World

   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled, it will ignore <b>// prints Hello World</b> and final executable will produce the following result:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello World
</pre>
<p>Within a /* and */ comment, // characters have no special meaning. Within a // comment, /* and */ have no special meaning. Thus, you can "nest" one kind of comment within the other kind. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Comment out printing of Hello World:

cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World"; // prints Hello World

*/
</pre>
