<hr>
<p>C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.</p>
<p>As you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&amp;) operator which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following which will print the address of the variables defined:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main () {
   int  var1;
   char var2[10];

   cout &lt;&lt; "Address of var1 variable: ";
   cout &lt;&lt; &amp;var1 &lt;&lt; endl;

   cout &lt;&lt; "Address of var2 variable: ";
   cout &lt;&lt; &amp;var2 &lt;&lt; endl;

   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces result something as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Address of var1 variable: 0xbfebd5c0
Address of var2 variable: 0xbfebd5b6
</pre>
<h2>What Are Pointers?</h2>
<p>A <b>pointer</b> is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
type *var-name;
</pre>
<p>Here, <b>type</b> is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and <b>var-name</b> is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
int    *ip;    // pointer to an integer
double *dp;    // pointer to a double
float  *fp;    // pointer to a float
char   *ch     // pointer to character
</pre>
<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
<h2>Using Pointers in C++:</h2>
<p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. <b>(a)</b> we define a pointer variables <b>(b)</b> assign the address of a variable to a pointer and <b>(c)</b> finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator <b>*</b> that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main () {
   int  var = 20;   // actual variable declaration.
   int  *ip;        // pointer variable 

   ip = &amp;var;       // store address of var in pointer variable

   cout &lt;&lt; "Value of var variable: ";
   cout &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl;

   // print the address stored in ip pointer variable
   cout &lt;&lt; "Address stored in ip variable: ";
   cout &lt;&lt; ip &lt;&lt; endl;

   // access the value at the address available in pointer
   cout &lt;&lt; "Value of *ip variable: ";
   cout &lt;&lt; *ip &lt;&lt; endl;

   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces result something as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of var variable: 20
Address stored in ip variable: 0xbfc601ac
Value of *ip variable: 20
</pre>
<h2>C++ Pointers in Detail</h2>
<p>Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming. There are following few important pointer concepts which should be clear to a C++ programmer:</p>
