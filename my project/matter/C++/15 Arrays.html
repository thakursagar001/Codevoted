<center><h1>Array</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>C++ provides a data structure, <b>the array</b>, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>
<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index. </p>
<p>All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>
<h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>
<p>To declare an array in C++, the programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
</pre>
<p>This is called a single-dimension array. The <b>arraySize</b> must be an integer constant greater than zero and <b>type</b> can be any valid C++ data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double,
use this statement:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
double balance[10];
</pre>
<h2>Initializing Arrays</h2>
<p>You can initialize C++ array elements either one by one or using a single statement as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
</pre>
<p>The number of values between braces { } can not be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ]. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array:</p>
<p>If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created.  Therefore, if you write:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
</pre>
<p>You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
balance[4] = 50.0;
</pre>
<p>The above statement assigns element number 5th in the array a value of 50.0. Array with 4th index will be 5th, i.e., last element because all arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called base index. Following is the pictorial representaion of the same array we discussed above:</p>

<h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>
<p>An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
double salary = balance[9];
</pre>
<p>The above statement will take 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. Following is an example, which will use all the above-mentioned three concepts viz. declaration, assignment and accessing arrays:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
using std::setw;
 
int main () {
   int n[ 10 ]; // n is an array of 10 integers
 
   // initialize elements of array n to 0          
   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
      n[ i ] = i + 100; // set element at location i to i + 100
   }
	
   cout &lt;&lt; "Element" &lt;&lt; setw( 13 ) &lt;&lt; "Value" &lt;&lt; endl;
 
   // output each array element's value                      
   for ( int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++ ) {
      cout &lt;&lt; setw( 7 )&lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; setw( 13 ) &lt;&lt; n[ j ] &lt;&lt; endl;
   }
 
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This program makes use of <b>setw()</b> function to format the output. When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Element        Value
      0          100
      1          101
      2          102
      3          103
      4          104
      5          105
      6          106
      7          107
      8          108
      9          109
</pre>
<h2>C++ Arrays in Detail</h2>
<p>Arrays are important to C++ and should need lots of more detail. There are following few important concepts, which should be clear to a C++ programmer:</p>
